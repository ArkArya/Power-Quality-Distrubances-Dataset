The Power Quality Disturbances are coded and generated according to this following paper:  "Integral mathematical model of power quality disturbances" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8378902/

The parameters can be varied to generate different types of disturbances according to the paper. The generated disturbance signals are sampled at 16 kHz and the frequency and amplitude is taken 50 hz and 1 respectively.
